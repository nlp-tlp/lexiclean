# LexiClean: An annotation tool for rapid multi-task lexical normalisation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LexiClean v2 is currently being released. While it is currently testable, an updated video walk through is still pending and will be re-released by the 11th of November. In the meantime, please consult the original systems demonstration or documentation for more information.

LexiClean is a rapid annotation tool for acquiring parallel corpora for lexical normalisation built with MongoDB, React and FastAPI. A live demonstration of the tool can be found at https://lexiclean.nlp-tlp.org and a systems demonstration video at https://youtu.be/P7_ooKrQPDU.

## üì¶ Dependencies
To run LexiClean using Docker, you'll need:

- Docker Engine (see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Docker Compose (see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nlp-tlp/lexiclean.git
cd lexiclean
```

2. Create a .env file in the root directory with your desired configuration (or use the defaults in the docker-compose.yml).

3. Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will launch:

- Frontend at http://localhost:3000
- Backend API at http://localhost:8000
- Documentation at http://localhost:4000
- MongoDB at localhost:27018

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application consists of four main services:

- Frontend (React): User interface running on port 3000
- Backend (FastAPI): API server running on port 8000
- MongoDB: Database running on port 27018
- Documentation (React, Docasaurus): Service running on port 4000

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables
Key environment variables are configured in the docker-compose.yml:

**Backend (FastAPI):**
```
MONGODB__URI=mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/lexiclean?authSource=admin
MONGODB__DB_NAME=lexiclean
AUTH__SECRET_KEY=secret
AUTH__ALGORITHM=HS256
AUTH__ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=360
API__PREFIX=/api
```

**Frontend:**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
NODE_ENV=development
```

**MongoDB:**

```
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

If you prefer to run the application without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install MongoDB (v4.4.6 or later) (see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
2. Verify MongoDB is running:
```bash
service mongod status
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables as described in the Docker Compose section

5. Start the services manually:
```bash
# Start backend
cd server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd client
npm run dev
```
