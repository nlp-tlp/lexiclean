By accessing and using LexiClean (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these terms, please discontinue your use of the Service.

## 1. Data Storage and Security

LexiClean utilises [Auth0](https://auth0.com), a third-party authentication and authorisation service, to store user information and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), a third-party database service, to store user application data. While we strive to protect your data, LexiClean cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information you store or transmit through the Service. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the risks associated with data storage, including but not limited to, unauthorised access, data loss, or data corruption. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for any activities that occur under your account. LexiClean is not responsible for any issues or liabilities arising from the data storage services provided by Auth0 and MongoDB.

For more information on Auth0's security measures, please visit their [website](https://auth0.com/security), or for more information on MongoDB's security measures, please visit their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/security).

### 1.1 Account Deletion and Data Artifact Management

At LexiClean, we respect your right to privacy and control over your personal data and any data artifacts created on your account. Should you decide to terminate your account with LexiClean, you can request the complete deletion of your account along with all associated data artifacts. To initiate this process, [please contact us](./contact) with your account details and a request for account deletion. Our team will guide you through the necessary steps and ensure that your data is fully removed from our systems.

In the future, LexiClean plans to introduce a feature allowing users to automatically request the deletion of their accounts and associated data through the user interface. This feature is part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring our users' privacy and the secure handling of their data.
