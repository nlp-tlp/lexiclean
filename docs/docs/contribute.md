# Contribute

We are excited to invite contributions to LexiClean! Whether you're interested in contributing code through GitHub pull requests, identifying issues and bugs, or simply have suggestions for improvement, your involvement is highly valued.

:::warning Contribution Guidelines Under Development
We are currently in the process of crafting detailed guidelines for contributors to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process. We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm as we work on finalising these guidelines.
:::

In the meantime, if you're eager to contribute or have ideas you'd like to share, we encourage you to get started by:

- **Exploring Existing Issues**: Look through the current issues on our GitHub repository for areas where you can contribute.
- **Reporting New Issues**: If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please create a new issue on our GitHub page. Your reports are invaluable for improving the project.
- **Submitting Pull Requests**: If you've developed a fix or a new feature, we welcome pull requests. While our formal contribution guidelines are still pending, we're open to early contributions and ready to collaborate with you to refine them.
- **Sharing Feedback**: We understand that not all contributions are code-related. If you have feedback, suggestions, or want to discuss potential improvements, please [contact us](contact).

Your contributions are what make community-driven projects like ours thrive. We look forward to your involvement and are here to support you in making meaningful contributions to our project. Stay tuned for updates on our contribution guidelines!
