# Self-hosting LexiClean

:::warning
We're in the process of developing this feature. Your patience is appreciated as we work to make self-hosting a robust option for LexiClean users. Updates will be posted here once available.
:::

This guide outlines steps for deploying LexiClean within your own infrastructure, addressing the needs of organisations with strict data privacy policies that restrict the use of cloud-based platforms. While self-hosting is an option, we recommend using our hosted service when possible to minimise risks of data loss or operational issues. Our commitment to data sovereignty ensures users maintain control over their data, aligning with our broader application philosophy.

Before proceeding, please review our privacy policy, specifically the [Data Storage](privacy-policy#2-data-storage) section, to ensure LexiClean's handling of data does not meets your organisational requirements.

## Considerations for Self-Hosting

- **Data Privacy and Control**: Self-hosting LexiClean is ideal for organisations needing to comply with strict data residency or privacy regulations. It ensures all data remains within your controlled environment.

- **Operational Responsibility**: Opting for self-hosting means taking on the responsibility for maintaining the application, including updates, security patches, and ensuring high availability.

- **Technical Requirements**: Deployment requires a suitable infrastructure and expertise in managing web applications. Details on the technical prerequisites will be provided in the full guide.

- **Support and Updates**: While we strive to support all our users, priority assistance and automatic updates will be more readily available for our hosted version users.

## Next Steps

Stay tuned for the complete self-hosting guide, which will include detailed instructions on setting up LexiClean in your environment, including server requirements, installation procedures, and configuration tips for optimal performance and security.

Your understanding and patience as we finalise these capabilities are greatly appreciated. We're excited to offer this flexibility to our users and will provide detailed documentation to ensure a smooth transition to a self-hosted setup.
