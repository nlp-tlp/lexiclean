# Schema Editor

## Overview

The **Schema Editor** is a tool that supports the lifecycle of semantic token-level labels that are used to tag tokens in LexiClean projects. These tags support your annotation projects by providing structured semantics on tokens which can be used for various applications such as identifying quality issues, providing arbitrary semantics, identifying sensitive information, etc.

Inputs:

- Give your entity a label name (unique)
- Give your entity label a description (optional)
- Give your entity label a color (selection)
- Enter or paste in new-line separated label values
- Button: create/update.
