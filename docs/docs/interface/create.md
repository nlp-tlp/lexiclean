# Project Creation

Creating a project with LexiClean involves a few straightforward steps. Navigating to the project creation page (`/create`) is as simple as clicking "New Project" in the left sidebar. Each section below will guide you through this process.

:::info
LexiClean automatically indicates where your input is required and confirms when your inputs are valid.
:::

## Details

Begin by defining the core aspects of your project:

- **Project Name**: Choose a unique name that reflects the essence of your project. Remember, this can be modified later if needed.
- **Project Description**: Provide a brief overview of your project. This helps annotators understand the context and objectives. You're free to update this description as your project evolves.

## Data

Please visit the [Concepts: Datasets](../concepts/datasets) page for detailed information on the different types of datasets that can be used in LexiClean.

## Preprocessing

:::info
Real-time corpus metrics will be presented to you based on the preprocessing options you select.
:::

During project setup, you'll have access to real-time corpus metrics influenced by your chosen preprocessing options:

- Lowercase: Standardise your text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Remove Characters: Clean your text by removing unwanted characters.
- Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate entries to refine your corpus.

Metrics Displayed:

- Corpus Size
- Vocabulary Size
- Token Count

A corpus preview is available, showcasing a snippet of your text after preprocessing. This ensures your preprocessing choices align with your project goals before finalising.

## Replacements

:::info
Streamline your corpus effortlessly with our replacement feature, which automates the detection and update of specific words (tokens). As of now, we cater to single-word replacements, but exciting updates are on the horizon! Ready to optimise your project? You can either manually input or paste your replacement dictionary directly in JSON format.
:::

Please visit the [Replacements Editor](./replacements-editor) page for detailed information on how to interact with this component.

</div>

## Schema

:::info
Here you can create a schema of entity labels for token-level entity tagging to support your annotation project.
:::

Please visit the [Schema Editor](./schema-editor) page for detailed information on how to interact with this component.

</div>

## Flags

:::info
Flags are powerful tools for highlighting texts that require extra attentionâ€”be it for uncertainty, the need for further clarification, or quality enhancement. For instance, flag texts that seem ambiguous or might benefit from a second review.

## Settings

<!-- - Are there any special tokens in your project?

Enter your special tokens separated by commas (e.g., `<id>`, `<sensitive>`, etc). These tokens will be recognised as part of the vocabulary when your project is created.

- Apply Replacement Dictionary Automatically?

Enable this to auto-apply replacements to your corpus for faster annotation. You can revert these changes anytime.

- Auto-label Words Using Your Schema?

Activating this will apply your schema labels automatically to your corpus, accelerating the annotation process. Changes are reversible.

- Treat Digits as In-vocabulary?

This treats numerical values (e.g., 1, 22, 388) as known vocabulary. Note: This action is permanent.

- Prioritise Texts with Inverse TF-IDF?

LexiClean can prioritise your texts based on 'value-add' of normalisations, using an inverse tf-idf strategy on masked out-of-vocabulary tokens. -->

Finalise your project with these settings:

- **Special Tokens**: List any tokens unique to your project (e.g., `<id>`, `<sensitive>`). These will be included in your project's vocabulary.
- **Automatic Replacement Dictionary Application**: Opt to automatically apply your replacement dictionary to streamline the annotation process.
- **Auto-labeling with Schema**: Enable this to apply schema labels to your corpus automatically, boosting the efficiency of the annotation workflow.
- **Digit Recognition as In-vocabulary**: Opt to treat numerical values as known vocabulary. This setting is irreversible.
- **Text Prioritisation with Inverse TF-IDF**: Activate to prioritise texts based on the potential impact of normalisations, employing an inverse TF-IDF strategy for out-of-vocabulary tokens.

By following these steps and utilising LexiClean's features, you'll be well on your way to efficiently creating a project tailored to your annotation needs.
