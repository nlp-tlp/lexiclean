# Project Feed

## Overview

The **Project Feed** serves as your central hub for accessing and managing projects you own or participate in as an annotator. Presented through an intuitive card-based layout, the Project Feed offers a snapshot of each project's key details and progress. Here's what you'll find on each project card:

- **Name**: The project's title.
- **Total Texts**: The count of texts included in the project.
- **Project Type**: The category of the project, detailed in [Concepts: Datasets](../concepts/datasets).
- **Annotators**: The number of collaborators actively working on the project.
- **Texts Annotated (all annotators)**: The tally of texts annotated by the team.
- **Texts Annotated (you)**: How many texts you've personally annotated.
- **Created Date**: The date the project was initiated.

Each card features dual linear progress bars that visually compare your annotation progress with that of the entire team. Additionally, two actionable buttons provide direct access to the project's [Dashboard](dashboard) and the [Annotation View](../category/annotation-view) for detailed work and review.

Starting a new project is straightforwardâ€”simply click on the `Create New Project` card at the beginning of your feed.
