# Token Contextualizer

## Overview

The **Token Contextualizer** is a crucial component designed to enhance data annotation accuracy by providing detailed insights into the modification history of a token within your project.


## How to Use

To use the Token Contextualizer, begin by selecting any token within your project. Upon selection, the component reveals:
- The **current value** of the token,
- Its **original value** (highlighted if it has been modified),
- A **summary of modifications** that have occurred in the past, showcasing similar changes, including the types of transformations and their frequencies.

## User Interface

## Contextualizer UI

Below is an example of the Contextualizer's user-interface for the selected token "change out" which has been replaced from its original value of "c/o". Here, you can see that the "c/o" has been replaced to "change out" and "change/out" for the given project -- making the erroneous "change/out" evident and the correct correction "change out" apparent.
