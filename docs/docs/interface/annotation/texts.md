# Texts

## Overview

Text containers are the main elements of LexiClean's Annotation View. They are composed of two components:

- **Action Tray**: This is where text-level controls are located, and
- **Tokens**: These are editable and markup-able components. Find out more about them [here](tokens)

## Action Tray

The action tray includes tools for managing invidual texsts, including:

### Save Button

- **Save Button**: Toggles the saved state of a text.

### Flags Button

- **Flags Button**: Allows adding flag labels to a text. Directs users to the dashboard if no flags are set up.

### AI Suggestion Button

- **AI Suggestion Button**: Activates the OpenAI GPT model for suggesting text improvements, available with a valid OpenAI API key.

### Token Indicator

- **Tokens Indicator**: Displays the number of tokens in the text.

### Document Index

- **Document Index**: Shows the text's sequence number. Hovering over it reveals more details like the text's rank, weight, and any associated external IDs.
