# Tokens

#### Tokens

The fundamental elements of LexiClean, allowing users to interact with and enhance the text through lexical normalisation and semantic tagging. Tokens can be edited by clicking and typing, as well as by right-clicking to reveal contextual context menus. Each token is coloured based on its current classification where the colour scheme is:

- Orange: the token is out-of-vocabulary (looked up from a predefined English lexicon and any user defined replacements)
- Green: the token is being edited or has had a replacement made.
- Blue: the token has a replacement suggestion.
- Red: the token has been deleted and is represented by an empty string.
