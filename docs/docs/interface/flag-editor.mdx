# Flag Editor

## Overview

The **Flag Editor** empowers you to define and manage text-level "flags" within your project. These flags serve as markers for annotators to note ambiguity, point out quality concerns, or add other relevant meta information during the collaborative annotation process. Right from the outset, during [project creation](create), you can establish an array of flags tailored to your project's needs. Any adjustments to these flags can later be made through the [Project Dashboard](dashboard).

### ## How to Use - Creating and Managing Flags

- **To Add a Flag**: Simply type the flag's name into the input field and click the "add" button.
- **To Edit a Flag**: Click on a flag to bring up a text field, where you can edit the flag's name. Confirm changes with the "update" button, and these modifications will apply to all instances of that flag.
- **To Remove a Flag**: Click the "x" on the flag's chip to delete it. Note, this action is irreversible, so proceed with caution. When in doubt, consider adding a new flag instead of removing an existing one to preserve historical annotations.
